# UI TDD Phases 0-15 Implementation Status

## Scope

This document records the canonical `UI_TDD_PHASE_PROMPTS.md` Phase 0-15 order completed on 2026-05-09.

The checkout was reconciled to the tracked Phase 13 UI baseline rather than rebuilt from a docs-only reset. That baseline already included the vanilla DOM renderer, `node:test` harness, screen models, static build, product dev server, production static/proxy server, Docker contracts, and same-origin `/api/*` browser boundary.

## Phase Map

| Phase | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| 0 Baseline Reconciliation And Harness | Complete | `test/baseline-reconciliation.test.js` proves package scripts, renderer runtime, route shell, API boundary, and browser secret guardrails after restoring the tracked baseline. |
| 1 Product Contract, IA, And UX Guardrails | Complete | `test/app-shell.test.js`, `test/design-tokens.test.js`, and `test/api-boundary.test.js` cover reserved IA, token metadata, dense operator UX assumptions, and secret-free browser source. |
| 2 Backend Compatibility Smoke | Complete | `web/src/server/backendCompatibilitySmoke.js` classifies proxy failure, backend route drift, auth failures, schema drift, compatible responses, and backend errors for `/api/system`, `/api/leads`, `/api/pipeline/runs`, `/api/stats`, `/api/alerts`, and `/api/leads/{id}/raw`. |
| 3 API Client Contracts | Complete | `web/src/api/*` centralizes same-origin clients for leads, lead detail, lead mutations, raw audit, outreach, pipeline runs, stats, alerts, and system health. |
| 4 Today Command Center | Complete | `test/today-command-center.test.js` covers priority leads, aging work, alerts, failed jobs, health, route ownership, states, responsive metadata, and token use. |
| 5 Lead Inbox | Complete | `test/lead-inbox-screen.test.js` and `test/lead-inbox-client.test.js` cover filters, columns, priority ordering, states, keyboard activation metadata, responsive modes, and API-backed contracts. |
| 6 Lead Detail Evidence Workspace | Complete | `test/lead-detail-screen.test.js` covers Summary, Source Evidence, AI Enrichment, Actions, Outreach, Activity, raw audit links, corrections, states, and responsive metadata. |
| 7 Lead Status, Ownership, And Corrections | Complete | `test/lead-status-state-model.test.js` and `test/lead-status-mutation-client.test.js` cover transitions, valid actions, invalid action blocking, notes, snooze dates, ownership, and auditable corrections. |
| 8 Verification Queue And Raw Audit Review | Complete | `test/verification-queue.test.js` and `test/raw-audit-client.test.js` cover queue inclusion rules, verify/correct/dismiss/return actions, raw audit aliasing, and blocked redaction policy metadata. |
| 9 Outreach Workspace And Activity Log | Complete | `test/outreach-workspace.test.js` and `test/outreach-client.test.js` cover editable drafts, contact fields, copied/sent/logged states, outcome logging, activity entries, and no auto-send policy. |
| 10 Pipeline Monitor And Run Controls | Complete | `test/pipeline-monitor.test.js` and `test/pipeline-client.test.js` cover run history, collector counts/failures, LLM health, delivery failures, and async manual run creation. |
| 11 Analytics And Demand Signals | Complete | `test/analytics-dashboard.test.js`, `test/analytics-screen.test.js`, and `test/stats-client.test.js` cover distributions, denominators, date ranges, source yield, aging, verification quality, and demand timing. |
| 12 Alertd Read-Only Console | Complete | `test/alert-console.test.js` and `test/alert-client.test.js` cover alert state, SPS, evidence, room inventory, action history, Slack-first policy, and disabled mutations. |
| 13 Session/Auth And Same-Origin Runtime | Complete | `test/session-deployment.test.js` and `test/api-boundary.test.js` cover `UI_ENABLED`, `UI_BASE_PATH`, `UI_SESSION_SECRET`, session-cookie API authorization, production request-handler gating before `/api/*` proxying, same-origin credentials, security headers, and browser secret scans. |
| 14 Docker Integration And E2E Smoke | Complete | `test/dockerization-contract.test.js`, `Dockerfile`, `compose.dev.yml`, and server/runtime modules cover test image, dev product server, production static/proxy runtime, ports, healthchecks, backend discovery, and secret-free config. |
| 15 Browser UX Hardening | Complete at deterministic renderer level | `test/browser-ux-hardening.test.js` and `web/src/renderer/browserUxHardening.js` cover route-specific focus labels, accessible names, rendered desktop/tablet/mobile route variants, text-containment policy, stable loading/error/empty states, and same-origin API metadata. Screenshot/pixel checks remain blocked until a deterministic browser harness is introduced. |

## TDD Evidence

- Red: `node test/baseline-reconciliation.test.js` failed with `package.json should exist` before restoring the tracked UI baseline.
- Red: `node test/phase-13-renderer-runtime.test.js` failed until `/api/leads/{id}/raw` was added to the backend compatibility smoke contract.
- Red: `node test/lead-inbox-client.test.js` failed with `client.getLead is not a function` before the detail client was added.
- Red: `node --test test/browser-ux-hardening.test.js` failed with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` before the Phase 15 hardening module was added.
- Green: focused tests for baseline reconciliation, API boundary, lead client contracts, renderer/runtime smoke, and browser UX hardening passed.
- Green: `npm run build`, `npm test`, Docker test-image build/run, production image build, and production-container smoke checks for `/healthz`, `/`, and `/assets/app.js` passed after implementation.

## Verification Refresh

- 2026-05-09: `npm test` passed 26/26 suites after rechecking the Phase 0-15 implementation against `docs/web-app-phase-prompts.md`.
- 2026-05-09: `npm run build` regenerated the static app successfully with no tracked `web/dist` diff.
- 2026-05-09: `docs/web-app-phase-prompts.md` was updated so its older supporting checklist reflects the completed Phase 0-15 implementation status recorded here.
- 2026-05-09: production request-handler coverage now proves `/api/*` session gating and baseline browser security headers before backend proxying.
- 2026-05-09: Phase 15 renderer evidence now requires route-specific focus labels and rendered desktop/tablet/mobile modes for all primary routes.
- 2026-05-09: Phase 1 token guardrails now cover `text-input-focused` and the `property-row` background contract from `DESIGN.md`.

## Residual Risk

The current Phase 15 proof is deterministic HTML/model-level hardening, not Playwright or a real browser engine. Real focus traversal, computed layout, screenshots, pixel checks, and overlap detection should be added once the repo accepts a browser harness dependency.
