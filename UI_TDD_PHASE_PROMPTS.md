# GroupScout Web App TDD Phase Prompts

> Planning artifact. Every implementation phase must use strict TDD: write a failing test first, run the narrow red command, implement the smallest change, rerun the narrow command, then run the relevant broader suite.

## Companion Docs

- [Web App Brainstorm](./docs/web-app-brainstorm.md)
- [Phase Prompt Pack](./docs/web-app-phase-prompts.md)

## Global Rules

- [ ] Use beads for task tracking before code changes.
- [ ] Check current repo state before edits; do not revert user changes.
- [ ] Start every phase by restating goal, workflow, out-of-scope items, and acceptance criteria.
- [ ] Write tests before implementation.
- [ ] Confirm the red failure is for the expected missing behavior.
- [ ] Implement only enough code/docs/runtime behavior to pass.
- [ ] Rerun the narrow test and then the relevant broader suite.
- [ ] Preserve browser-only access through same-origin `/api/*` contracts.
- [ ] Keep secrets server-side: no `API_TOKEN`, provider keys, Slack tokens, Resend keys, database URLs, `OLLAMA_ENDPOINT`, or `UI_SESSION_SECRET` in browser-visible code/assets/config.
- [ ] Use `DESIGN.md` tokens and UX direction: dense operator surfaces, Inter prose, Geist Mono for structured values, hairline borders, compact controls, black primary buttons, mint only for active/confirmation accents.
- [ ] Treat raw source evidence, AI enrichment, reviewer corrections, outreach logs, and status history as distinct audit concepts.
- [ ] Add follow-up beads issues for known gaps instead of hiding them in comments or unchecked assumptions.

## Implementation Status

Completed on 2026-05-09 in the current canonical phase order. See [UI TDD Phases 0-15 Implementation Status](./docs/ui-tdd-phase-0-15-implementation.md) for the phase map, red/green evidence, residual risk, and the restored-baseline decision.

## Phase 0 - Baseline Reconciliation And Harness

### Prompt

```text
You are working in /mnt/c/Users/alvin/WebstormProjects/groupscout-ui. Strictly follow TDD.

Goal: reconcile the current UI checkout with the latest Phase 13 UI baseline before product work begins.

Context:
- The current working tree has local deletions of the previous UI source, tests, package file, docs, and Docker files.
- origin/main contains the latest UI updates: vanilla DOM renderer, node:test suite, static build, product dev server, production static/proxy server, and backend compatibility smoke classification.
- Do not revert user changes unless explicitly directed.

TDD requirements:
1. Add or restore only the smallest test/harness files needed after deciding the baseline strategy.
2. If restoring from origin/main, first add a failing smoke or docs-guardrail test that proves the expected baseline is absent in the current checkout.
3. Run the narrow red command.
4. Restore or recreate the minimal harness to pass.
5. Rerun the narrow command and record the result.

Do not build new product features in this phase.
```

### Tasks

- [ ] Record current `git status` and identify user-owned changes.
- [ ] Decide whether to restore Phase 13 files from `origin/main` or continue from a minimal docs-first baseline.
- [ ] Add a failing baseline smoke for package scripts, route shell, renderer runtime, and secret guardrails.
- [ ] Run the focused red command.
- [ ] Restore or recreate the minimum harness.
- [ ] Rerun focused tests.
- [ ] Update docs with the chosen baseline decision.

## Phase 1 - Product Contract, IA, And UX Guardrails

### Prompt

```text
Strictly follow TDD.

Goal: establish the product contract and visual guardrails for the GroupScout operator workbench.

Context:
- The app is a dense evidence-first operations console, not a CRM replacement or marketing site.
- Use DESIGN.md tokens and UX direction.
- Initial IA: Today, Leads, Verification, Outreach, Pipeline, Analytics, Alerts, Settings.

TDD requirements:
1. Write failing tests for route shell IA, design token availability, reserved navigation labels, and no direct browser references to secrets.
2. Write failing tests or docs assertions for dense operator UX requirements: compact tables, filters, tabs, detail evidence, and responsive variants.
3. Run red.
4. Implement the smallest shell/token metadata needed.
5. Rerun tests.

Do not implement feature screens or live API calls in this phase.
```

### Tasks

- [ ] Test route list and default route.
- [ ] Test `DESIGN.md` token mapping for colors, typography, spacing, radius, and key components.

- [ ] Implement shell placeholders only after tests fail.
- [ ] Document UX guardrails.

## Phase 2 - Backend Compatibility Smoke

### Prompt

```text
Strictly follow TDD.

Goal: turn backend/UI route assumptions into compatibility smoke tests before wiring screens to live data.

Context:
- Backend docs conflict on whether UI /api/* routes are implemented.
- Backend Compose service is groupscout on 8080.
- Browser-visible code must call same-origin /api/* only.

TDD requirements:
1. Write failing smoke classification tests for /api/system, /api/leads, /api/pipeline/runs, /api/stats, /api/alerts, and /api/leads/{id}/raw.
2. Distinguish proxy failure, backend 404 route drift, auth failure, schema drift, compatible response, and backend error.
3. Run red against a documented live backend or stub.
4. Implement only the classifier/client smoke harness, not route fixes.
5. Rerun focused tests.

Do not hide route drift behind fixtures.
```

### Tasks

- [ ] Inventory backend live routes.
